The goal with lazypede.py was to begin to learn to automate larger projects with a very simple starting project.

I was given four fasta (text) files and a taxonomic list, where the taxa in the fasta files were represented only by their MCZ numbers. Before attempting to automate my search and replace over four files I used bbedit search/replace to make strings of the taxa+mcz numbers formatted the way they needed to be.

Then I wrote a script to scrape the formatted document and create a dictionary with a regex of the format using MCZ# as keys.
Then I read through the 4 files and wrote new "edit" files with the MCZ numbers replaced by the format needed.

Pretty straightforward, but I'm sure I'll need some version of this script again so I'll stash it here, annotated.

Lazypede.py is the script, in_list is an example of the formatting.
