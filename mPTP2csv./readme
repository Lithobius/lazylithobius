This script makes output from mPTP (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/14/063875) into a CSV so that the species delimitation information can be added to other spreadsheets

If there's things in the header other than what was in my test file, the part of the loop that looks for header info may need more " or line.startswith() " exceptions added to reflect that
