This script substitutes a specific number for another in a large batch of filenames.

I needed to update a lot of legacy numbers to current numbers in filenames in order to even begin to dig through their contents.
There are a lot of versions of this sort of script easily found by googling but none of them fit my exact needs (or I didn't find the one that would have) so I added a few extra steps to make it work for my needs.

This will work in the instance:
18sf_18sr_DNA111111_taxon.abi -> 18ssf_18sr_MCZ_IZ222222_taxon.abi

Light modifications to the regex pattern can make it universal for any systematically named series of files.
